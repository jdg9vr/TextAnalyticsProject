58,1,1, has extensive experience in the aluminum sand casting foundry industry
58,1,2," The process of pouring molten aluminum into a sand mold continues to be a cost effective process, supplying parts to a variety of industries"
58,1,3," Because of its positive features, aluminum remains the metal of choice across the automotive industry"
58,1,4," Notwithstanding the automotive industry, aluminum sand casting continues to be used in other areas of the transportation industry including in aircraft and marine applications"
58,1,5,"Other industries served include machine tool fabrication, communication, medical and laboratory testing equipment, and food preparation machinery"
58,1,6," Aluminum sand casting is the right choice for products that require hollow cavities and complex, unique arrangements of voids, shapes and ribs"
58,1,7, Aluminum sand castings can be supplied in sizes from fractions of an ounce to 400 pounds
58,1,8, from 3/8 inch to 120 inches in width or length

58,2,0,"Hebert Foundry and Machine, Inc"
58,2,1, is a family owned and operated business with nearly 100 years of experience in the green sand casting and machining industries
58,2,2," Our staff of engineers, patternmakers, and metallurgists will ensure that your company chooses the right material and pattern to address your green sand casting needs"
58,2,3, Green Sand Casting continues as the most widely used and cost effective process for sand casting
58,2,4, The process begins with the creation of a pattern that duplicates the shape of the desired part
58,2,5," Depending on the application of the part and desired outcome, HFM offers two sand compositions for the no bake sand casting process"
58,2,6, One no bake sand casting process utilizes a molding material that is low cost and reusable
58,2,7," Typically, green sand is composed of washed, graded, dried, and screened/sized silica sand that is bonded with various natural clays and water"
58,2,8, Other ingredients are used to achieve specific properties to allow molten metal to be formed in “near net shape”
58,2,9, The alternative composition utilizes sand molds of chemically bonded sand that are only used once
58,2,10, This process is superior for heavier castings and generally exhibits better dimensional control than traditional green sand
58,2,11, The “no-bake” molds can be assembled to form intricate castings
58,2,12," Cores, created from various compositions within the mold cavity, form the internal (and sometimes intricate) structure of hollow castings"
58,2,13," The green sand casting process, and the no-bake sand casting process, facilitates the casting of complex parts"
58,2,14, Castings produced from green sand handle vibration and stress much better than assemblies secured by fasteners
58,2,15," HFM green sand castings reduce weight and furnish rounded edges that are safer and more aesthetically pleasing than sharp, machined edges"
58,2,16, The green sand casting process reduces the need for assemblies which significantly minimizes the need for machining and ultimately improves the tolerance of the finished product

82,6,13, It is essential that only high purity (99
82,6,14,99 + 0/0) zinc metal be used in the formulation of alloys
82,6,15," Low limits on lead, tin and cadmium ensure the long-term integrity of the alloys strength and dimensional stability"
82,6,16, Zinc-aluminum (Za) Alloys ZA alloys represent a family of zinc-based die casting materials which contain higher aluminum content than standard zinc alloys
82,6,17, These alloys provide high strength characteristics plus high hardness and good bearing properties
82,6,18, Thin wall castability characteristics and die life are similar to zinc alloys
82,6,19," ZA-8 is recommended for hot chamber die casting, whereas ZA-12 and ZA-27 must be cast by the cold chamber die casting process"
82,6,20, All ZA alloys offer similar creep properties and are superior to standard zinc alloys
82,6,21, Four-Slide Die Casting Four-Slide Zinc Die casting is a special method of Die Casting requiring a special type of Die Casting machinery
82,6,22, SDC uses Dynacast Model 2A machines
82,6,23," While being limited on size (Max part weight 40g), the machines are extremely efficient & highly accurate"
82,6,24, Parts are cast to net shape at speeds up to 40 shots/min
82,6,25, Most tooling for the 4 slide machine will be more economical than for conventional die cast tooling
82,6,26," If you require small complex parts in high volumes over 25,000 per order, the multi-slide approach may be you best solution"
82,6,27," Typical applications are connectors, small housings, office parts, small valves, munitions components, air fittings, special components, fractional motor brackets, Nano technology packaging"

113,5,0,Quality Aluminum and Zinc Die Casting Quality Aluminum and Zinc Die Casting Information WHAT IS DIE CASTING
113,5,1, Die casting process The basic die casting process consists of injecting molten metal under high pressure into a steel mold called a die
113,5,2, Die casting machines are typically rated in clamping tons equal to the amount of pressure they can exert on the die
113,5,3," Machine sizes range from 200 tons to 5,000 tons"
113,5,4," Regardless of their size, the only fundamental difference in die casting machines is the method used to inject molten metal into a die"
113,5,5, The two methods are hot chamber or cold chamber
113,5,6," A complete die casting cycle can vary from less than one second for small components weighing less than an ounce, to two-to-three minutes for a casting of several pounds, making die casting the fastest technique available for producing precise non-ferrous metal parts"
113,5,7," Die construction Dies, or die casting tooling, are made of alloy tool steels in at least two sections, the fixed die half, or cover half, and the ejector die half, to permit removal of castings"
113,5,8,  There are four types of dies
113,5,9," Single cavity to produce one componentMultiple cavity to produce a number of identical partsCombination die to produce several different parts for an assemblyUnit die to produce different parts at one timeFrom a design point of view, it is best to design parts with uniform wall thicknesses and cores of simple shapes"
113,5,10," Heavy sections cause cooling problems, trapped gases causing porosity"
113,5,11, All corners should be radiused generously to avoid stress concentration
113,5,12, Draft allowance should be provided to all for releasing the parts – these are typically 0
113,5,13,25º to 0
113,5,14,75º per side depending on the material
113,5,15," Die Casting Advantages Die casting is an efficient, economical process offering a broader range of shapes and components than any other manufacturing technique"
113,5,16," Parts have a longer service life when compared to plastic, and may be designed to complement the visual appeal of the surrounding part"
113,5,17, Designers can gain a number of advantages and benefits by specifying die cast parts
113,5,18, High-speed production – Die casting provides complex shapes within closer tolerances than many other mass production processes
113,5,19," Little or no machining is required, and thousands of identical castings can be produced before additional tooling is required"
113,5,20,"Dimensional accuracy and stability – Die casting produces parts that are durable and dimensionally stable, while maintaining close tolerances"
113,5,21,Strength and weight – Die cast parts are stronger than plastic injection moldings having the same dimensions
113,5,22, Thin-wall castings are stronger and lighter than those possible with other casting methods
113,5,23," Plus, because die castings do not consist of separate parts welded or fastened together, the strength is that of the alloy rather than the joining process"
113,5,24,"Multiple finishing techniques – Die cast parts can be produced with smooth or textured surfaces, and they are easily plated or finished with a minimum of surface preparation"
113,5,25,"Simplified Assembly – Die castings provide integral fastening elements, such as bosses and studs"
113,5,26," Holes can be cored and made to tap drill sizes, or external threads can be cast"
113,5,27," From a design point of view, it is best to design parts with uniform wall thicknesses and cores of simple shapes"
113,5,28," Heavy sections cause cooling problems, trapped gases causing porosity"
113,5,29, All corners should be radiused generously to avoid stress concentration
113,5,30, Draft allowance should be provided to all for releasing the parts-these are typically 0
113,5,31,25º to 0

113,6,0,"Quality Aluminum and Zinc Die Casting Quality Aluminum and Zinc Die Casting Die Casting Alloys ALLOYS  Die casting alloys are normally non-ferrous, and there is a large number available with a wide range of physical and mechanical properties covering almost every conceivable application a designer might require"
113,6,1," Aluminum and zinc alloys are the most widely used, and are followed by magnesium, zinc-aluminum (AZ) alloys, copper, tin and lead"
113,6,2," Zinc, lead, and tin based alloys are classified as low melting point metals, all melting at less than 725oF (385oC)"
113,6,3, Zinc-aluminum (ZA) alloys have a slightly higher melting range of 800oF to 900oF (426oC to 482oC)
113,6,4," Aluminum and magnesium alloys are considered to be moderate melting point alloys, being cast in the 1150oF to 1300oF (621oC to 704oC) range"
113,6,5," Copper alloys are considered to be high melting pint, over 1650oF (899oC)"
113,6,6, Low melting point alloys are cast in hot chamber machines
113,6,7, Intermediate and high melting point alloys are cast in cold chamber machines
113,6,8," In recent years, specially designed hot chamber machines for die casting magnesium alloys have come into use Aluminum alloys Aluminum die casting alloys are lightweight, offer good corrosion resistance, ease of casting, good mechanical properties and dimensional stability"
113,6,9," Although a variety of aluminum alloys made from primary or recycled metal can be die cast, most designers select standard alloys listed below"
113,6,10, 360 — Selected for best corrosion resistance
113,6,11," Special alloys for special applications are available, but their use usually entails significant cost premiums"
113,6,12, 380 — An alloy which provides the best combination of utility and cost
113,6,13, 383 & 384 — These alloys are a modification of 380
113,6,14," Both provide better die filling, but with a moderate sacrifice in mechanical properties, such as toughness"
113,6,15," 390 — Selected for special applications where high strength, fluidity and wear-resistance/bearing properties are required"
113,6,16, 413 (A13) — Used for maximum pressure tightness and fluidity
113,6,17, Zinc alloys Zinc base alloys are the easiest to die cast
113,6,18," Ductility is high and impact strength is excellent, making these alloys suitable for a wide range of products"
113,6,19, Zinc alloys can be cast with thin walls and excellent surface smoothness making preparation for plating and painting relatively easy
113,6,20, It is essential that only high purity (99
113,6,21,99 + 0/0) zinc metal be used in the formulation of alloys
113,6,22," Low limits on lead, tin and cadmium ensure the long-term integrity of the alloy’s strength and dimensional stability"
113,6,23, Zinc-Aluminum ZA alloys ZA alloys represent a new family of zinc based die casting materials which contain higher aluminum content than standard zinc alloys
113,6,24, These alloys provide high strength characteristics plus high hardness and good bearing properties (Table 2)
113,6,25, Thin wall castability characteristics and die life are similar to zinc alloys
113,6,26," ZA-8 is recommended for hot chamber die casting, which ZA-12 and ZA-27 must be cast by the cold chamber die casting process"
113,6,27, All ZA alloys offer similar creep properties and are superior to standard zinc alloys
113,6,28," ZA-8 — Provides strength, hardness and creep properties"
113,6,29," ZA-12 — Provides excellent bearing properties with strength and hardness characteristics between ZA-8 and ZA-27, plus good dimensional stability properties and somewhat better castability than ZA-27"
113,6,30," ZA-27 — Offers the highest mechanical properties of the ZA family and is, therefore, recommended when maximum performance is required"
113,6,31," Magnesium alloys Magnesium alloys are noted for low weight, high strength to weight ratio, exceptional damping capacity, and ease of machining"
113,6,32," Casting temperatures are about the same as aluminum, and both hot chamber and cold chamber machines are used to produce castings"
113,6,33, Casting rates for magnesium are high because of its low heat content which produces rapid solidification
113,6,34," For the same reason, less energy is required to heat the metal to casting temperature"
113,6,35, AZ91HP (high purity) alloy has been developed for die casting parts subject to corrosive environments
113,6,36," Because of lower levels of nickel, iron, copper and silicon versus AZ91B, this alloy is finding applications in automobiles, computers and peripheral equipment, and in other applications where paint or coatings are either undesirable or expensive"
113,6,37," Although magnesium die castings are used uncoated, they can be finished in a variety of ways to give increased protection against corrosion, wear and abrasion resistance, and to improve appearance"
113,6,38," Common inorganic treatments include chemical dips, anodizing and plating"
113,6,39," Organic coatings — oil, wax, resin or paint — are usually applied over chemical treatments or anodizing to seal the surface, increase corrosion protection and provide an attractive appearance"

121,1,2,  These systems are essentially a compact sewage treatment plant
121,1,3,"  Waste is aerobically treated and processed, treated with liquid chlorine in the form of standard household bleach and typically dispersed on top of the ground by means of sprinklers"
121,1,4,  The aerobic system provides a homeowner or other facility with an alternative where conventional or other type septic systems won't function
121,1,5,  An aerobic system is extremely efficient and is rapidly becoming the system of choice for onsite sewage disposal
121,1,6, HOW THE AQUA AIRE®SEWAGE TREATMENT SYSTEM FUNCTIONS The Aqua Aire® sewage treatment plant in many ways is a scaled down version of larger township and municipality sewage treatment plants
121,1,7, It employs an extended aeration activated sludge process
121,1,8, This type of treatment depends primarily upon the use of air that is introduced by passing through the diffuser bar
121,1,9,Ecological Tanks Inc
121,1,10,", Aqua Aire®"
121,1,11, Wastewater from your home enters the first compartment of the tank where the solids are settled out
121,1,12,  Then it flows directly into the mixing tank where simple hydraulic displacement is accomplished by the introduction of air which promotes the growth of aerobic organisms in much larger amounts than would occur naturally
121,1,13, These break down the organic solids in the wastewater
121,1,14,The Aqua Aire® model AA500-4075 is a four compartment rectangular configurations partitioned by internal dividing walls in the treatment plant
121,1,15," It is comprised of a forward pre-treatment tank, an aeration mixing zone, a settling or clarifier compartment and a rear pump tank compartment"
121,1,16," Wastewater first enters the pre-treatment tank compartment of the plant, then gravity flows through a 4"" SDR 35 PVC inlet to the aeration mixing zone"
121,1,17, The mixed liquid then enters the settling or clarifier compartment and continues to flow upward to the discharge pipe
121,1,18," From the plant’s discharge pipe, the final effluent then passes through a disinfection or chlorination device into the pump tank compartment for storage and contact mixing"
121,1,19," The treated and disinfected effluent is then safely discharged, via an application pump, to a surface spray, subsurface drip, low pressure dose or absorptive mound disposal area"
121,1,20," The result of the Aqua Aire process is a clear, odorless effluent discharge, which meets and exceeds state and national water quality standards"

121,2,1," On-Site Waste Water Treatment Experts Home Septic Systems Precast Products Services Resources About Gallery Contact More Low Pressure Systems The Low Pressure Dosing (LPD) System works well in soils in which conventional, gravity-flow systems have failed"
121,2,2, Such soils are typically tight clay soils in which there is no evidence of a seasonal high-water table (as evidenced by mottling or discoloration of the soil)
121,2,3,The sewage is treated in the same manner as in a conventional dual-compartment septic tank
121,2,4," Once the partially treated sewage leaves the second compartment of the tank, it gravity flows into the pump chamber from which it is pumped into a drainfield consisting of small-diameter, perforated pipes"
121,2,5, These perforated pipes are placed in a narrow trench on a bed of gravel at a depth of from 18-36 inches and covered with a geotextile fabric
121,2,6, The trench is backfilled with Class II soil
121,2,7, The effluent is forced into the surrounding soil where the wastewater treatment process is completed
121,2,8, Proper design and installation is important in order to avoid the possibility of the contamination of ground water
121,2,9,LPD system drainfields are sized according to gallons per day of anticipated water usage
121,2,10," therefore, use beyond these limits results in ponding of effluent on the surface of the drainfield"
121,2,11, The careful monitoring of water conservation measures is extremely important to the proper functioning of LPD drainfields

134,3,0,"506 Rosamond, Houston TX, 713-695-4008 Specializing only inAluminum, Brass & Bronze Alloys About Coastal Foundry Coastal Foundry Company was founded as an aluminum foundry in 1947 in a garage in the back yard of the present premises and began by manufacturing lighting fixtures"
134,3,1, We’ve come a long way since then
134,3,2, Harold Gluckman purchased the foundry in 1978 and over the next 40 years added numerous new machines and equipment to keep up with the increase in production caused by the oil boom at that time
134,3,3, An automatic green sand regeneration system was one of the many items installed
134,3,4," In 1980, an additional 15,000 square feet of building was added and in 1988, the original old garage and wooden building was replaced with a new 10,000 square foot steel building"
134,3,5, Brass and bronze were added to the range of metals poured and today Coastral Foundry manufactures castings in a number of different aluminum and copper based alloys
134,3,6," The foundry premises today consists of 2 acres of land with approximately 30,000 square feet of production facilities"
134,3,7," The production equipment used is considerable, involving numerous molding machines, shell core machines, automatic sand recirculation systems, compressors, gas fired furnaces, an induction furnace, cut-off machines, grinding machines, a wheelabrating machine, vibratory deburring machine, a sand recycling plant and many other items of machinery used in the casting process"

134,3,9, Industries Served Marine This thru hole bronze transducer posed several challenges
134,3,10, It required 0
134,3,11,125” to 0
134,3,12,1875” thin walls and a solid stem requiring M22x1
134,3,13,"5 machine threading, with no porosity, which can be hugely challenging to produce"
134,3,14, We poured with approved 92200 navy bronze
134,3,15," With our pattern set up and gating as to not interfere with the cosmetics of the casting in finishing, we utilized other proprietary molding methods and adjusted the temperature of the alloy for optimal flow to cast a very high-quality part with no issues"
134,3,16, Oil and Gas The aluminum impeller required us to come up with a way to pour with A356
134,3,17,2 T6 without the possibility of porosity throughout and hold the strength all the way thru to the impellers vanes
134,3,18," considering that the finished impeller sits inside a housing for a degasser and spins at a high rate of speed requiring fine balanced machining and all vanes worked to high tolerances, solidity and no porosity was a must"
134,3,19, Since the vanes extrude out from a solid circle we decided to direct pour the alloy into the mold from a center pad instead of gating with contacts at certain areas of the pattern and adjust the temperature of the alloy poured to optimize the flow all the way from the center to the outer vanes
134,3,20, The outcome was a very high-quality casting that machined great and approved for production
134,3,21, Customer Testimonials  The piston you made for us cleaned up & looked nice once finished

254,15,7, Uses
254,15,8, Why use Skirtliners
254,15,9, Skirtliners are used in a feed hopper along the bottom edge of the sidewall to stop dirt and rock that has dropped onto a belt or an apron feeder pan from spilling over the edge
254,15,10," Skirtliners form the shape of the belt load as the belt carries the material away, to ensure it is not overloaded and doesn’t spill over"
254,15,11, Depending on the speed of the belt and the abrasiveness of the material it can be a high wearing area
254,15,12, It is desirable to have the bottom of the skirt liner running as close as possible to the passing belt because should a rock  lodge between the belt and the liner it can rip the belt  causing major disruption while it is repaired and costing a large amount to fix
254,15,13, For this reason it is important to be able to adjust the liner height
254,15,14, How do Skirtliners work
254,15,15, Keech Skirtliners can be changed out by one person and result in reduced shut down times
254,15,16, Maximum wear protection extends the life of valuable mining and industrial equipment

454,6,0,Advantages Advantages of Aluminum Sand Casting Process The sand casting process offers many distinct advantages when compared to alternative metal casting methods
454,6,1," When the versatility, unit costs, quality, availability and all other factors are considered, using sand molds for manufacturing aluminum castings is the clear choice"
454,6,2," Aluminum parts cast in sand molds, and which will be machined, are highly competitive with gray iron, notwithstanding the higher cost per pound of material"
454,6,3, The following represents some of the clear advantages of the aluminum sand casting process
454,6,4," Flexibility of DesignIntricately cored parts and parts with feet, bosses or other unwieldy protuberances can be cast soundly"
454,6,5," Wide Range of Alloys and Properties AvailableProperties range from 16k to 50k tensile with varying degrees of machinability, corrosion resistance, etc"
454,6,6, Lowest Tooling Cost – Shortest Lead TimeUnmachined patterns are cheaper and faster to build lower overall the overall cost of casting production and shortening turn-around time
454,6,7, Long Tool LifeThe aluminum sand casting process uses expendable molds
454,6,8," Hot metal, which causes deterioration of permanent-mold tooling and adversely affects quality of the cast parts, never touches the tooling (pattern)"
454,6,9," High Production Rates for Large Range of PartsThe many molding options available to sandcasters, from squeeze jolt machines to high pressure automatic molding machines, combined with the use of multi-impression matchplates, permits the manufacture of thousands of parts per day"
454,6,10," Ease of Product ModificationWith shorter “Life of Product” cycles than in the past, the ease of altering tooling is increasingly important"
454,6,11," Least Sensitive Gating, Feeding and Heat Removal System in Mass ProductionPouring temperatures in permanent molds should be held to +/- 20° for optimum results"
454,6,12," In sand, good castings can normally be obtained with temperature differences as high as +/- 40% and generally in a much lower temperature range"
454,6,13, High Density Molds Produce Good Surface FinishHigher mold squeeze pressures combined with technological improvements in sand preparation produce castings with a surface finish that rivals the permanent mold processes

457,10,0,219-362-8531 The Shell Mold Process  Hiler Industries boasts two modern foundries that produce millions of castings every year â all using the shell mold process
457,10,1," Since 1946, we have been providing our customers the highest quality castings, in a variety of metals, all with an excellent surface finish and near-net shape"
457,10,2, Superior Machining QualitiesA major benefit of shell molding is the excellent machining characteristics achieved through this process
457,10,3, Many photomicrograph inspections have shown that shell castings have what might be termed âcooling rate inversion
457,10,4,"â Unlike green sand castings, permanent mold and die castings â which all have hard skins and âsoftâ interiors â shell mold castings have âsoftâ skins and hard or dense interiors"
457,10,5," As a result, shell mold castings have superior machining qualities vs"
457,10,6, green sand and other types of castings
457,10,7, Less WeightAnother major benefit is that less machining stock is required
457,10,8," Over the years, we have found that "
457,10,9,060 stock is more than ample
457,10,10," In fact, if the job were to be machined in our machine shop, we would add only "
457,10,11,040 stock
457,10,12, This is helpful in two ways

494,2,0,"Design & Process Guidelines When designing a casting, active participation should take place between the Design Engineer, the casting producer and the machining source"
494,2,1, Meloon Foundries LLC does this through direct contact with the casting buyer
494,2,2, Pattern or ToolingA significant variable in the construction of a pattern is the determination of the shrink factor
494,2,3, The shrink factors vary for different metals and also the configuration of the part
494,2,4," The number of impressions, the gating system, the process or methodology will affect the casting cost"
494,2,5, This is better left to the foundry and pattern maker to determine
494,2,6, Process GuidelinesIt is important that the foundry and the casting purchaser work closely together in order for the casting producer to make an acceptable cost effective part
494,2,7, Producing a casting for the first time entails a certain amount of trial and error
494,2,8,It is an experienced-based development process
494,2,9, The expertise and past experience with similar casting configurations provide a guideline for the initial production
494,2,10, Usually the more intricate the casting design and the more drastic the change in section thickness the less predictable the casting soundness
494,2,11,"This is why it is important to consider location of isolated heavy sections, uniform wall thicknesses and correct placement or ribs and junction design"
494,2,12, Visual casting soundness many times is not sufficient to verify acceptability and machining the sample casting prior to production release is important
494,2,13, SpecificationsOver specifying can increase the cost of a casting appreciable
494,2,14," Proper alloy selection, welding permissibility, correct choice of temper, and final inspection criteria all figure into casting cost"
494,2,15,Under specifying leads in many cases to misunderstanding between the casting producer and the casting supplier
494,2,16, Castings that are designed for critical applications require specific quality criteria
494,2,17, Selection of material that does not meet environmental or mechanical properties frequently leads to poor casting performance
494,2,18, New Jobs Rapid PrototypingRapid Prototyping is the developing of a temporary pattern or tooling from a 3-D computer design
494,2,19, This temporary tooling reduces casting time from months to days
494,2,20, The computer model is used as the blue-print and its dimensions to produce a model
494,2,21, Any rapid prototype pattern that is durable enough to withstand green sand or no bake molding can be used
494,2,22, There are several rapid prototyping processes and the selection depends on the application

588,4,0,Permanent Mold Process Melling Engineered Aluminum Castingshas four gravity fed tilt pour permanent mold machines that employ both permanent and  semi-permanent cores for production
588,4,1, Permanent mold casting process has re-useable molds that are typically cast iron or coated with refractory coatings
588,4,2," Different types of coatings are used for insulating, chilling, lubricating, and releasing properties"
588,4,3," After the coatings have been applied the mold is heated to production temperature, and Aluminum is then poured into ‘pour cups’ on the mold"
588,4,4," The machine tilts the cavity from horizontal to vertical, filling the runners and casting cavity from the bottom"
588,4,5, After a period of solidification the machine tilts back to horizontal and ejects the casting
588,4,6," Permanent mold casting provides improved surface finish, and dimensional accuracy compared to sand casting"
588,4,7," Other advantages of permanent mold include forced directional solidification, finer grain structure and reduced wall thickness"

588,5,0,Shell cores are ideal for light castings when the weight is critical and to provide increase dimensional controls and surface finish compared to other core production processes
588,5,1, Shell Core Process The shell core process is a hot box operation
588,5,2, The cast iron box is heated to operating temperature and resin coated sand is blown into the box
588,5,3, The heat cures  the resin and binds the sand grains creating a shell
588,5,4," The longer the cure, the thicker the shell"
588,5,5, Sand Identification Core sand is classified based on the American Foundry Society  Grain Fineness Number and the resin content
588,5,6, Both the fineness and resin  content heavily influence the type of sand used in a specific part
588,5,7, Melling Engineered Aluminum Castings determines sand type based on customer requirements and casting process  criteria to ensure a quality core and ultimately a sound casting
588,5,8," Assembly Process Part specific, engineered assembly fixtures designed for  repeatability, efficiency, and full communication between components"
588,5,9,  Cores are produced individually then combined as a “core pack
588,5,10,"”  Assemblies can utilize internal/external chaplets, hot set glue, solvent  paste and compression techniques"
588,5,11, The goal of the assembly design and  process is to minimize necessary manufacturing aids (i
588,5,12,e
588,5,13," chaplets,  etc"
588,5,14,)
588,5,15, Cores are ready to be placed into molds as one unit after  assembly
588,5,16,"Utilizing the core assembly process we can reduce the cycle time, the potential for defects in the casting, and reduce the cost of your casting"
588,5,17, Equipment Redford-16 Semi-automatic Shell Core Machine 2 Redford-43A Shell Core Machines Foundry Automation Dual Station Shell Core Machine HS-22RA Shell Core Machine Coresare molded sand that create internal passages to accommodate draft or integrate details that cannot be machined in the casting

674,3,0," Investment         Casting Process  Conventional Shell Casting Investment casting, or the ""lost wax"" process         has been in use since the construction of the first pyramid"
674,3,1, The Egyptians         and Chinese used the process in their early history to make statues and         jewelry
674,3,2," The investment casting method was largely ignored as an industrial         process for the fabrication of parts until the demand for rapidly finished         parts during World War II created the need for ""near net-shape"" components         that could readily be put into their final form"
674,3,3," At this time new inorganic         high temperature ceramic mold binders were developed to industrialize         the process applications to include high strength and corrosion resistant         materials such as low to high carbon alloy steel, tool steel, stainless         steel, and nickel and cobalt base alloys"
674,3,4, Aluminum and brass alloys are         available also
674,3,5, It is a process capable of producing intricate shapes weighing         from a small fraction of an ounce up to forty pounds or more
674,3,6, Some examples         would be
674,3,7," dental appliances, jewelry, components for the automotive industry,         military weaponry, jet engines, aircraft structural parts, machinery         components, and many others"
674,3,8," In general, an injection molded wax pattern         is used for each part produced which is then encased in multiple layers         of ceramic material"
674,3,9, The wax pattern is then removed from the ceramic         shell mold
674,3,10, The mold is fired in an oven and then molten metal is poured         into the cavities left by the evacuated wax pattern
674,3,11," Upon cooling, the         resulting precision castings are cleaned and subjected to further processing         such as heat treatment"
674,3,12," At this point, many parts are in their final form         and are ready for use while others may require a small amount of further         processing such as machining before reaching their final form"
674,3,13," Because         we build our ceramic molds exclusively by hand, we specialize in producing         complex detail, which is not always possible for foundries that utilize         robots"
674,3,14," Our cosmetics are as good as any foundry can offer, better than         most"
674,3,15," Chicago Vacuum produces castings with an exceptionally smooth finish,         typical dimension accuracy of +/- "

674,4,2,         Below are a few examples of casts we have produced for our customers
674,4,3, Exceptional Quality   BEFOREThese two-iron parts were produced using the sand-casting process
674,4,4, Several secondary     machining operations were required to properly fit carbide drilling inserts     into the internal detail of the parts
674,4,5, Notice the rough finish and lack of     detail
674,4,6, AFTERChicago Vacuum Casting reduced the machining operation cost for these two parts     by using the investment casting process
674,4,7," These parts were cast to net shape,     eliminating all machining operations"
674,4,8," Cast from high strength steel alloy,     these parts now have superior detail - see the detail in the part number"
674,4,9, Exceptional         Detail Chicago Vacuum Casting can also give your designs freedom when producing           precision small parts
674,4,10, This example has twelve 
674,4,11,020 diameter holes           at the top of the part

674,5,1, Works of art were created 	    from hand sculptured wax patterns with delicate detail as sophisticated 	    as any precision investment casting produced today
674,5,2," Industrial America paid little heed to the capabilities of Investment           Castings in Lost Wax until WWII, when sudden military demands overtaxed           the machine tool industry"
674,5,3," By injecting wax into a permanent-molding           die to form a pattern, investment casting became the solution for many         complex parts that were required in staggering quantities"
674,5,4," During the 	      postwar period, this process has evolved and expanded into virtually 	    every industry and marketplace, as seen today"

674,9,4," When properly applied, 	    our advancing technology can offer complex ""near         net-shapes"" that reduce overall manufacturing costs by minimizing         material and labor inputs"
674,9,5," Parts designs can be lighter in weight, more         complex and are available in a wider range of alloys than those offered         by other processes"
674,9,6," Stronger materials, better surface finishes, thinner         walls, difficult internal configurations and closer tolerances than those         available through alternate processing techniques are some of the other       advantages of the investment casting process"

1142,1,0,"Magnetic Materials Rare Earth Magnets  High Performance Magnets Alnico Magnets - High Performance The most common magnetic materials in use today are alnico, ceramic (hard ferrites), samarium cobalt, and neodymium"
1142,1,1,  Each are made up of different elements used for different applications
1142,1,2, Short Timeline of Modern Permanent Magnets A big step in the evolution of the permanent magnet materials used today came in the 1930’s with the development of Alnico magnets
1142,1,3," In 1931, T"
1142,1,4," Mishima discovered that an alloy of iron, nickel, aluminum had a much higher coercivity than the best steel magnets of the time"
1142,1,5," Further research created alnico, a term referring to a series of permanent magnet alloys which in addition to iron are composed primarily of aluminum (Al), nickel (Ni) and cobalt (Co)"
1142,1,6, Various alnico grades with differing magnetic properties can be achieved by modifying the chemistry and manufacturing process
1142,1,7," Today’s composition of alnico alloys is typically 8–12% Al, 15–26% Ni, 5–24% Co, up to 6% Cu, up to 1% Ti, with the balance being Fe"
1142,1,8," In addition to varying the alloy composition, specialized casting techniques can be used to achieve unique crystalline grain orientation"
1142,1,9, Examples of this are alnico 5-7 and 9
1142,1,10," Once magnetized, Alnico magnets have between 5 and 17 times the magnetic force of magnetite or lodestone, a naturally occurring magnet which can attract iron"
1142,1,11," Alnico magnets have the benefit of having the lowest temperature coefficient, or temperature stability of all of the permanent magnet materials"
1142,1,12," Plus, they can be calibrated and have high residual induction"
1142,1,13,"Before the development of rare earth magnets in the 1970’s, alnico was the strongest type of permanent magnet"
1142,1,14," Since that time, many applications using alnico have replaced it with less expensive or more powerful types of magnets"
1142,1,15," However, the fact that alnico can be used in very high temperatures (up to 930°F or 500°C) make them indispensable in certain applications"
1142,1,16, Alnico magnets are also ideal for corrosive applications and are commonly used for various types of sensors
1142,1,17," They are stronger than ceramic magnets, but not as strong as rare-earth magnets"
1142,1,18, Manufacturing Processes
1142,1,19, Alnico magnets are manufactured either by casting or sintering
1142,1,20," Most alnico produced is anisotropic, meaning that the magnetic direction of the grains is oriented in one direction"
1142,1,21,  This orientation is achieved via heat treatment after casting or sintering
1142,1,22,  The process involves heating the cast or sintered part above its Curie temperature and then cooling it at a controlled rate in the presence of a strong directional magnetic field
1142,1,23,  Final shaping of the alnico materials is achieved by abrasive grinding and cutting where close tolerances are required
1142,1,24, Properties
1142,1,25," Hard Ferrites Ceramic magnets, like the ones used in refrigerator magnets and elementary-school science experiments, contain iron oxide in a ceramic composite"
1142,1,26,"  Most ceramic magnets, sometimes known as ferrite magnets, aren’t particularly strong"
1142,1,27, Ceramic permanent magnets are made from finely powdered barium ferrite or strontium ferrite formed under heat and pressure
1142,1,28,  Their magnetic strength is enhanced by aligning the powder particles with a strong magnetic field during forming
1142,1,29,  Ceramic magnets are somewhat comparable to alnico magnets in terms of magnetic force and have the advantage of being able to be pressed into various shapes without significant machining
1142,1,30,"  However, hard ferrites are not magnetically stable at higher temperatures"
1142,1,31,"  They are typically used in magnets where price is a primary driver, rather than size or mass"
1142,1,32, Advantages
1142,1,33, Disadvantages
1142,1,34," Samarium Cobalt Magnets In the 1970s, researchers developed permanent magnets made from powdered samarium cobalt fused under heat"
1142,1,35,  Samarium cobalt magnets can be made to produce magnetic fields 50 times stronger than magnetite
1142,1,36,"  Samarium cobalt magnets can operate in higher temperatures, but cannot be calibrated"
1142,1,37," Samarium cobalt magnets are made mostly from samarium and cobalt, with small amounts of other elements such as iron, copper, zirconium and hafnium"
1142,1,38,  The majority of the material is cobalt
1142,1,39,  They are typically used in higher temperature applications where the strength of rare earth magnets is still needed
1142,1,40,"  They have a higher Curie temperature than NdFeB, but are also more expensive to manufacture"
1142,1,41, Neodymium Iron Boron Magnets The newest permanent magnet material was developed in the 1980s using powdered neodymium iron boron (NdFeB)
1142,1,42,  This type of magnetic material produces magnetic forces almost 75 times stronger than magnetite
1142,1,43,  These are the most powerful permanent magnets commercially available today
1142,1,44," Neodymium magnets are made up of neodymium, iron and boron, with the majority being iron"
1142,1,45,  They are the strongest type of permanent magnet available
1142,1,46,"  While they have the highest magnetic field strength, they have a lower Curie temperature and are more vulnerable to oxidation than samarium cobalt magnets"
1142,1,47,"  Corrosion causes the material to crumble into a powder, losing their magnetic properties"
1142,1,48, Bonded or Flexible Permanent Magnets Bonded or flexible permanent magnets are made from mixing magnetic materials with a rubber or plastic matrix
1142,1,49,  Nearly any magnet material can be used to create a bonded magnet
1142,1,50,  The most common bonded materials incorporate either hard ferrites or NdFeB
1142,1,51,"  For instance, powdered barium ferrite or strontium ferrite can be mixed in a binding material such as rubber or a flexible plastic like polyvinyl chloride, to form a bonded magnet material"
1142,1,52,  The magnetic performance of the bonded magnet can be impacted by the concentration level of magnet material to binder
1142,1,53," Alnico magnets have the benefit of having the lowest temperature coefficient, or temperature stability, of all of the permanent magnet materials"

1181,14,7," Alnicomagnets are made from iron alloyed primarily with aluminum, nickel, and cobalt, thus the name, though they can also include copper or titanium, and these magnets have been around since the 1930s"
1181,14,8,"While not the strongest magnets when compared to rare earth magnets, they have the highest range of operating temperatures"
1181,14,9," As temperature increases, magnets begin to lose strength, and when the temperature reaches theCurie temperaturefor that magnetic material, they lose all magnetization and become useless as magnets until remagnetized"
1181,14,10," The Curie temperatures for Alnico magnets are the highest, in the range of 800° C and with a maximum normal operating temperature in the range of 500° C"
1181,14,11," Depending on the exact Alnico alloy, Alnico magnets can be isotropic, able to be magnetized in any direction, while others are anositropic, having a preferred direction of magnetization"
1181,14,12," They are less resistant to corrosion than the rare earth magnets, but not so much as the ferrites"
1181,14,13," Though the oldest of the four categories of magnets listed above, their combination of strength and thermal characteristics makes them still relevant today, and they are used in such areas as the manufacture of guitar pickups, electric motors, microphones, sensors, and loudspeakers"
1181,14,14," Ceramicmagnets (Ferritemagnets) were also originally developed in the 1930s, with technological advances increasing their magnetic strength to the levels we see today"
1181,14,15," They are made from iron (III) oxide mixed with other elements such as strontium, barium, manganese, nickel, or zinc, and are strong, very resistant to corrosion, retain their magnetism very well, and economical of cost"
1181,14,16," This combination of factors makes ceramic magnets the magnet of choice for applications such ourModel 1057lifting magnet, able to lift up to 2500 pounds of steel plate, as well as for magnetic sign capping with ourMagna Caps"
1181,14,17," Unusually compared to other ferromagnetic materials, ferrite magnets are not conductors of electricity"
1181,14,18," They have a good operating temperature range, though with a Curie temperature in the range of 450° C not to the level of Alnico magnets"
1181,14,19," Due to the combination of cost and power, ceramic magnets see wide applications industrially in lifting and separating, and because of their lack of electrical conductivity, find use in transformers and even electromagnets to control eddy current losses"
1181,14,20," The core memory of early computers was made with ferrite cores, and ferrite particles and powder are even used in magnetic recording tape as well as in radar-absorbing stealth technology"
1181,14,21," Neodymiummagnets are the magnets people usually mean when they speak of rare earth magnets, though there are actually 17 rare earth elements, and samarium-cobalt magnets are also rare earth magnets"
1181,14,22," They have the highest strength for their size, of all the types of magnets you can buy today, which makes them the choice when power is the only consideration, but they have significant disadvantages as well"
1181,14,23," They were discovered in the 1980s independently by General Motors and by Sumitomo Special Metals and are available in several grades of strength, from N28 to N52 (the strongest)"
1181,14,24," All are anisotropic, strongly having a preferred direction of magnetization and difficult to magnetize in other directions"
1181,14,25, They tend to be vulnerable to corrosion and are thus often covered with a protective coat
1181,14,26," Neodymium magnets are very costly, and not generally suitable for high-temperature applications due to their lowish Curie temperatures, in the 300-400° C range"
1181,14,27," Even with these disadvantages however they find wide usage, in applications from electric motors and computer hard drives to magnetic bearings and loudspeakers"
1181,14,28," Samarium-Cobaltmagnets are our final class of magnets, and they, like neodymium magnets, belong to the category of rare earth magnets"
1181,14,29," Like neodymium magnets they are quite strong, though not quite so much so as the neodymium"
1181,14,30," When you add in the fact that they are also brittle, like neodymium magnets, but are even more costly, you might think that there is no reason for using them, but they do have one large advantage over neodymium, and that is the operating range of temperatures, with Curie temperatures in the range of 700-800° C, about twice as high as for neodymium"
1181,14,31," AtMagnetic Specialties, we have dealt with all of these from the ceramic magnets utilized in ourModel 1037, 1037jr,and otherlifting magnets, to custom-designed neodymium applications"

1191,1,0,Open The Door Products About us The Founder ofOpen The Door Productshas over 50 years of experience in the custom cabinetry industry
1191,1,1, We sincerely believe that life is about relationships
1191,1,2," the better our relationships, the better our lives"
1191,1,3," It is our goal to create relationships of the highest integrity with our suppliers, employees, distributors, cabinet shops, and the end users"
1191,1,4,  Our Purpose Our purpose is to fulfill a 40 plus year need for a better magnetic catch
1191,1,5," Most magnetic catches are noisy, hard to open, and cheap-looking on high-quality cabinetry"
1191,1,6," All other types of latches such as ball catches, roller catches and turn latches require that you push and follow the door until it is completely closed"
1191,1,7," Spring-loaded hinges were developed to solve this problem, but they fall short of filling all the requirements of inset cabinetry because an adjustable door stop is still needed"
1191,1,8,"  Many “purist” designers prefer the appearance of an exposed “butt-type” hinge, which opens 180 degrees rather than the 110/120 degrees of a concealed euro hinge"
1191,1,9, Another need in the high-end custom cabinet industry is a way of preventing warped doors
1191,1,10," Our catch employs two high-strength, high-grade permanent neodymium magnets with enough force to pull in mildly warped doors"
1191,1,11," It also stands to reason that if a magnet can pull in warped doors, the constant force will help to prevent most doors from warping in the future"
1191,1,12," We have even seen our magnets pull in non-warped doors to compensate for improperly installed cabinets that are ""racked"""
1191,1,13, How valuable is the warped door prevention to you
1191,1,14, Consider how much it costs to replace a door
1191,1,15," How nearly impossible it is to produce a new door that matches well because it is probably not made from the same batch of wood, possibly made and finished by different people, and will not have the same amount of aging"
1191,1,16," This benefit alone could nearly offset the difference in the cost of the soft close magnetic catches and you also have the advantage of quiet, soft-closing and easy to open action, which is a great sales advantage for your product"

1191,3,4,2969 oropenthedoor@frontier
1191,3,5,com Where can we buy the products
1191,3,6, SeeContactus What wood species are available
1191,3,7," Inventoried wood species are maple, cherry, walnut, red oak, white oak, and mahogany"
1191,3,8, other species are available by special order
1191,3,9, Why do you use wooden mounting bases
1191,3,10," Die cast metal and plastic-mounting bases are available on the market, however they are too low-profile to work properly on inset cabinetry"
1191,3,11, The corresponding door magnet is too close to the edge of the door
1191,3,12, Another reason is that they do not provide the adjustability that is needed with most cabinetry
1191,3,13, A third reason is that a mounting base made of wood that matches the cabinet interior will visually blend in and be less noticeable
1191,3,14, These units are designed first for great function and then to blend in with the cabinet interior
1191,3,15, What makes these closers so quiet
1191,3,16, We use two precisely tuned magnets to draw the door closed in combination with a shock absorber to keep the door from slamming or bouncing open
1191,3,17," Additionally, we do not allow the magnets to make contact by separating them with a soft, pyramid-shaped neoprene bumper"
1191,3,18, What type of magnets are used
1191,3,19," The Neodymium, rare earth, magnets are made to our specific ""tuned"" size, strength and grade"
1191,3,20, They are permanent magnets tested to lose less than 5% of their strength of 10 years
1191,3,21, How can your magnets be strong enough to pull in warped doors and still be easy to open
1191,3,22, Most magnets are rated by theirholdingforce
1191,3,23," To create ease of opening, we do not allow the two magnets to make contact by applying a pyramid-shaped, soft neoprene bumper between them"
1191,3,24," This also makes them very quiet, but creates the need for fine tuning the strength and grade of the magnets to off-set the resistance of the shock absorber"
1191,3,25, Can the wood mounting bases be finished to match cabinet interiors
1191,3,26," Yes, you can paint over the existing natural finish (after removing the shock), or by ordering unfinished units in maple, cherry, walnut, red oak, white oak, and mahogany"
1191,3,27, Other wood species are available by special order with longer lead times and a minimum order
1191,3,28, Do mounting bases have to be disassembled to finish
1191,3,29, Only the shock must be removed because application of finish will likely inhibit it's function
1191,3,30, It is important that you do not apply an excessive amount of finish to the inside of the bore for the shock because it may cause the block to split when reinserting the shock
1191,3,31, you can paint or varnish over the magnet without affecting it's function
1191,3,32, What keeps the magnets in the mounting base and the cabinet door
1191,3,33, We use a pin that is pressed through the wood and a hole in the magnet to keep the magnet in the block
1191,3,34," Using the pin for mounting makes it possible to reverse the magnet polarity, if necessary"
1191,3,35," The corresponding door magnet fits tightly into a properly drilled hole, however we know that wood will dry out and this magnet could come loose"
1191,3,36, To prevent this possibility we use a screw mount door magnet
1191,3,37, Refer to theProductssection for a picture
1191,3,38, What type of shock absorber do you use and why
1191,3,39, We use an Italian-made shock by Salice because they are available in different strengths and the one that we use works best at dampening the drawing force of the magnets and preventing bounce if the door is slammed
1191,3,40," Other shocks on the market are self-adjusting, which does not work as well for our particular purpose"
1191,3,41, How difficult are your catches to install
1191,3,42, There is very little difference from installing a standard magnet with a metal plate
1191,3,43," there are two screws in the mounting base and one hole to drill in the cabinet door for the magnet to be glued in, The final step is application of the soft, pyramid-shaped bumper, which is self-adhesive"
1191,3,44, We recommend a placement jig and C-clamp for consistent mounting of the blocks in the cabinet and a drill press with a jig for consistent drilling of door magnet holes for high production efficiency
1191,3,45, What happens if my cabinet floor is not flush with the inside edge of my face frame
1191,3,46," There will be no problem if the floor is very, nearly flush (i"
1191,3,47,e
1191,3,48," within 1/32"" to 1/16"") with the inside of the face frame"
1191,3,49, The problem that can occur is the magnet in the door will become very close to the edge of the door
1191,3,50, This may create the need to shim the mounting base or request a higher mounting base made for your situation
1191,3,51, What height blocks are kept in stock for quick delivery
1191,3,52," The soft-close mounting blocks standard height is 3/4"""
1191,3,53, These are available in all of our normal wood species
1191,3,54," We now stock 7/8"" high blocks in maple, cherry, and walnut"
1191,3,55, These are used when cabinets are constructed with floors held down from the edge of the face frame so that the floor can be machined into the face frame
1191,3,56, Refer to theProductspage to see these blocks
1191,3,57, Can we get custom-sized mounting blocks
1191,3,58," Yes, in situations such as floors that are not flush with the top edge of the face frame you may need a higher block"
1191,3,59," These can be produced, but with longer lead times and minimum order quantities"
1191,3,60, What color door shocks are available
1191,3,61, Honey-colored shocks are standard
1191,3,62," White shocks are available, if requested only, when ordering unfinished maple blocks"
1191,3,63, The white shocks are ideal when cabinets are being painted to match light-colored painted interiors
1191,3,64, How long does it take for delivery
1191,3,65," We maintain a considerable inventory of all items shown in the ""Products"" section"
1191,3,66," Thus, we will normally ship via FedEx within one day of your order"
1191,3,67," Large or custom orders may take four to five weeks to produce, so we recommend that you order units when your project is sold rather than wait until the day you need them"

1200,5,8, There are many more reasons why you might decide to build a conservatory
1200,5,9," In Christchurch the ‘four seasons in one day’ climate always keeps us on our toes and, often makes it difficult to grow what we’d like or simply enjoy the view"
1200,5,10, Then there’s the cost-effectiveness – with a conservatory you get to add an extra room to your home while avoiding the price tag that comes with using conventional housing materials
1200,5,11, Despite the rise in popularity and quality of glass products we still see the occasional horror story from DIY disasters and unscrupulous installers

1216,1,0,Anodes  A galvanic anode is the main component of a galvanic Cathodic Protection (CP) system used to protect buried or submerged metal structures from corrosion
1216,1,1," They are made from a metal alloy with a more ""active"" voltage (more negative electrochemical potential) than the metal of the structure"
1216,1,2," The difference in potential between the two metals means that the galvanic an ode corrodes, so that the anode material is consumed in preference to the structure"
1216,1,3, The loss (or sacrifice) of the anode material gives rise to the alternative name of sacrificial anode
1216,1,4," Anode Materials There are three main alloys used as galvanic anodes, magnesium, aluminum and zinc"
1216,1,5," They are all available as blocks, rods, plates or extruded ribbon"
1216,1,6, Each material has advantages and disadvantages
1216,1,7, Aluminum Aluminum anodes have several advantages
1216,1,8," they are much lighter in weight, and have a much higher capacity than zinc"
1216,1,9, Their electrochemical behavior is not considered as reliable as zinc and greater care must be taken in how they are used
1216,1,10," When aluminum strikes a rusty surface a large thermite spark may be generated, so its use is restricted in tanks where there may be explosive atmospheres and there is a risk of the anode falling"
1216,1,11, Read more about ourAluminum Anodes
1216,1,12," Zinc Zinc is considered a reliable material but is not suitable for use at higher temperatures as it tends to passivate (it becomes less negative - if this happens, current may cease to flow and the anode stops working)"
1216,1,13,"It has a relatively low driving voltage, which means in higher resistivity soils or water it may not be able to provide sufficient current"
1216,1,14," However, in some circumstances, where there is a risk of hydrogen embrittlement for example, the low driving voltage is an advantage since overprotection is avoided"
1216,1,15, Read more about ourZinc Anodes
1216,1,16, Magnesium Magnesium has the most negative electropotential of the three (see Galvanic series) and is more suitable for areas where the electrolyte (soil or water) resistivity is higher
1216,1,17," This is usually on-shore pipelines and other buried structures, although it is also used on boats in fresh water and in water heaters"
1216,1,18," In some cases, the negative potential of magnesium can be a disadvantage"
1216,1,19," If the potential of the protected metal becomes too negative, hydrogen ions may be evolved on the cathode surface leading to hydrogen embrittlement or to disbonding of the coating , Where this is a possibility, zinc anodes may be used"
1216,1,20,  Read more about ourMagnesium Anodes
1216,1,21," Zinc and aluminum are generally used in salt water, where the resistivity is generally lower"
1216,1,22," Typical uses are for the hulls of ships and boats, offshore pipelines and production platforms, in salt-water cooled marine engines, on small boat propellers and rudders and for the internal surface of storage tanks"
1216,1,23," Since the operation of a galvanic anode relies on the difference in electropotential between the anode and the cathode, practically any metal can be used to protect any other, providing there is a sufficient difference in potential"
1216,1,24," For example, iron anodes can be used to protect copper"
